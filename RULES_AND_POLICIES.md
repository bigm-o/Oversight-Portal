# Ticket Tracker: Rules and Policies

This document outlines the usage policies, access levels, and operational rules for the Ticket Tracker application.

## 1. User Roles and Permissions

The system uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Each user is assigned a role that determines their default access levels.

### Role Matrix

| Role | Description | Default Page Access | Core Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Admin** | System Administrator | **All Pages** | User management, system configuration, and data integrity. |
| **Manager** | Strategic Oversight | Dashboard, Analytics, SLA, Reports | Monitoring high-level KPIs and business health metrics. |
| **Team Lead** | Operational Lead | Analytics, Dev Tracking, Jira Mapping, Ticket Movements | Managing team workload, sprint velocity, and ticket routing. |
| **Governor** | Governance & Compliance | All pages except Admin tools | Ensuring audit readiness and process compliance across teams. |
| **User** | General Access | None (Custom assigned) | Viewing specific dashboards as required for their function. |

### Access Definitions

*   **Executive Dashboard**: High-level summaries of platform health and incident trends.
*   **Development Analytics**: Deep dive into sprint metrics, story point distribution, and cycle times.
*   **Development Tracking**: Granular view of active tickets assigned to specific agile teams.
*   **Jira Mapping**: Strategic routing of Jira projects to internal agile teams.
*   **Ticket Movements**: Audit trail of ticket status transitions and justifications.
*   **Incident Tracker**: Real-time monitoring of L1-L3 incidents and service requests.
*   **SLA Compliance**: Governance view of response and resolution times against targets.
*   **User Management**: Administration of account access, roles, and platform invitations.

## 2. Operational Rules

### Jira Synchronization & Routing
*   **Zero-Leakage Model**: Every Jira project must be mapped to an internal team via the **Jira Mapping** tool. 
*   **Orphan Tickets**: Tickets that do not belong to an Epic are automatically routed to the "General Workload" of the team assigned to that Jira project.
*   **Manual Sync**: Administrators can trigger a manual sync to pull newly discovered Jira projects or refresh metadata.

### Ticket Movement Justification
*   **Rollback Auditing**: Any ticket moving from a "Done" or "Completed" state back to "In Progress" or "To Do" is flagged as a **Rollback**.
*   **Mandatory Justification**: Team Leads or assigned developers must provide a justification for rollbacks to maintain a high-integrity audit trail.

### User Onboarding
*   **Invitation System**: Users can only join the platform via a secure invitation link generated by an Admin.
*   **Link Expiry**: Invitation links expire after **48 hours**. If expired, a new invite must be generated.
*   **Deactivation**: Administrators can deactivate any account at any time. Deactivated accounts are immediately denied login access.

## 3. Data Governance

### Security
*   **Least Privilege**: Users should be assigned the minimum level of access required to perform their duties.
*   **Audit Logging**: The platform maintains an audit trail of all major configuration changes (e.g., project mapping changes, permission updates).

### Performance
*   **Data Freshness**: System data is synced periodically. For critical updates, use the "Sync" buttons available on relevant dashboard pages.
*   **Reporting**: Complex reports should be run during off-peak hours if possible to ensure dashboard responsiveness.
